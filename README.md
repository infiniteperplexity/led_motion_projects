
This repository stores code and other files for several experiments with motion-sensing props for dance and flow arts.

All use the Arduino-compatible Teensy microcontroller, digital RGB strips, and various motion sensors.

- The "Nine-Axis LED Fans" were laser-cut from HDPE, used WS2801 strips, and incorporated data from the BNO055 nine-axis motion sensor.
- The "Compass-only LED Fans" were laser-cut from decorative acrylic, used LPD8806 strips, and incorporate data from the LSM303 accelerometer-balanced compass.
- The "Gyroscopic LED Staff" was built from transparent PVC, used LPD8806 strips, and incorporated data from the L3G4200D three-axis gyroscope.
